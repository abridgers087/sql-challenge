1.  Data Modeling

    a.  Use the attached Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Entity Relationship Diagram for table and relationship data. 

2.  Data Engineering

    a.  Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:
    
        i.    Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
        ii.   For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite keyLinks to an external site., which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.
        iii.  Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.
        
    b.  Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.
